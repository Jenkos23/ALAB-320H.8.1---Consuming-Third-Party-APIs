# Starships App

## Description
The Starships App is a React application that fetches and displays a list of starships from SWAPI https://swapi.dev/api/. The application handles loading states and error handling gracefully, providing a smooth user experience. It showcases the power of React hooks and component-based architecture. 

## Note: A setTimer was used to load the content on the browser for 2000 seconds before display

## Features
- Lists starships with details such as name, model, manufacturer, and crew.
- Displays loading status while fetching data.
- Provides error messages in case of data fetching failure.
- Responsive and styled components for better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Custom Hooks
- CSS for styling

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starships-app.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd starships-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once the app is running, you should see a list of starships loading on the main screen. The app will display a loading message while fetching the data. In case of an error, an error message will be shown. If the data loads successfully, the starships will be displayed in individual cards with their details.

## Code Overview
The main components of the application include:
- **Home.js**: The main component that handles fetching the starship data and rendering the UI.
- **useStarships.js**: A custom hook for fetching starship data from a data source (e.g., an external API).

### Home Component
In the `Home.js` file, conditional rendering is implemented to handle different states:
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while data is being fetched.
- **Error State**: Displays an error message if there is an issue with the data fetch.
- **Data State**: Displays the list of starships fetched successfully.
